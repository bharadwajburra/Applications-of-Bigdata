APPLICATIONS OF BIGDATA IN HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY
Healthcare big data refers to collecting, analyzing and leveraging consumer, patient, physical, and clinical data that is too vast or complex to be understood by traditional means of data processing. Instead, big data is often processed by machine learning algorithms and data scientists. The rise of healthcare big data comes in response to the digitization of healthcare information and the rise of value-based care, which has encouraged the industry to use data analytics to make strategic business decisions.
